# Kaltura XML Schema
[[Edit on GitHub]](https://github.com/kaltura/kaltura-api-recipes/edit/development/swagger/markdown/schemas.md)

Kaltura XML Schema Definitions (XSDs) are standard W3C XSD version 1.0 formatted documents that define the structure of Kaltura’s XML-formatted integration interfaces.

Publishers and developers may use the schemas when applying or developing XML-based content management-related integrations with the Kaltura Platform. The Kaltura XML-based interfaces related to content management include bulk content ingestion, cue points handling, and content syndication.
Each XML schema:

* Defines XML elements and attributes
* Defines whether the element or attribute is required or optional, and the maximum number of appearances.
* Defines the content type of the XML element or attribute
* Defines the sequence order of the XML element or attribute within the XML
* Includes descriptions and examples of XML elements and attributes

The following XML types are supported:

* XMLs that are generated by the Kaltura server and as such are fully compliant with their schema definition.
  * **Examples**: Syndication Feed XMLs, Bulk Upload Results XMLs, Cue Point Serve XMLs
* XMLs that are submitted to the Kaltura server
  * **Examples**: Bulk Upload XMLs, Cue Point Ingest XMLs, Drop Folder XMLs  
  * Each XML document and file submitted to the Kaltura server is validated against its schema to ensure that a correct server action is committed. The following levels of validation apply:
    *     XML structure validation (including inspection of XML illegal characters such as: &, <, >, ’, ”, (, )
    *     Compliance of the XML with its schema, including element appearance, structure, and order
    *     Application level validation, including compliance of XML values with system and account-specific settings
